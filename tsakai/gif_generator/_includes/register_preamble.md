By registering, contestants and teams agree to the [rules and
regulations](/rules.html) governing the ICFP Programming Contest 2018.

Each team should register exactly once during the contest by providing a team
name and a team e-mail address.  (Team names and e-mail addresses can be changed
after registering by updating a team's [profile](/profile.html).)  Registering a
team will generate a team-specific public identifier (a 4-digit decimal string,
used in link anchors and public data) and a team-specific private identifier (a
32-digit hexadecimal string, used to [submit traces](/submit.html) and [update
profiles](/profile.html)).  **Be sure to record the team public and private
identifiers after registering.**  If a team loses its private identifier, then
the team should contact the [contest
organizers](mailto://icfpcontest2018@gmail.com) from the originally registered
team e-mail address.
